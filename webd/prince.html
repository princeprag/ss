	<h2 class="title" id="college"> MY COLLEGE - IIT GUWAHATI </h2>
	  <p> IIT Guwahati, this is indeed not just an engineering college or a place in the map of India but a heaven, heaven in terms of its culture & climate. Yup, the uncertainity in the climatic conditions here can drive one literally crazy. It is common here that you might feel the scorching heat of the Sun here at afternoon with no hopes of relief but soon be blessed with the showers of pleasure and excitement in the evening. Being a high altitude area the pleasent cool wind that blows through the campus in the evening takes all our anxiety and problems and fills us with a feeling of high hope and energy. We do a wide range 0f tasks in IIT Guwahati. From running like lunatics after the small clues & hints in the most awaited event of freshmen year - the <strong> SCAVENGER HUNT </strong> to dancing like never before in the auditorium during the pro-nites of <strong>techniche</strong>,we have done hilarious things that we never even expected to do in an engineering college.</p>

	  If not you will feel soon when I will take you to the visual trip of IIT Guwahati. We will be seeing the important places here and some amazing pics that will make you even more fascinated to join this  college...so here we go:
